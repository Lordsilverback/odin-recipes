            <li>2 pounds chicken thighs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon five spice powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon white pepper</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons hoisin sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine <em>(can substitue clear rice wine, dry sherry, or beer)</em></li>
            <li>2 teaspoons light soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon sesame oil</li>    
            <li>2 cloves garlic <em>minced</em></li>
            <li>5 drops red food coloring <em>(<u>optional</u>)</em></li>
            <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon maltose <em>(can substitute honey or brown rice syrup)</em></li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Instructions Simplified</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Trim the excess fat from the chicken thighs and discard. Combine the dark
                brown sugar, salt, five spice powder, white pepper, hoisin sauce, Shaoxing
                wine, soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, and red food coloring (if using) in a
                bowl to make the marinade(i.e. the BBQ sauce). Rub the chicken with the
                marinade in a large bowl or baking dish. Cover and refigerate overnight, 
                or at least 8 hours
            </li>
            <li>About 2 1/2 hours before you'd like to eat, take the chicken out of the
                refrigerator to come up to room temperature for even cooking. Preheat
                your oven to 375F (190C) and set a rack in the center of the oven.
            </li>
            <li>Line a sheet pan with heavy duty foil for easy clean-up, and place a sheet of
                parchment paper or non-stick foil on top. Evenly space the marinate
                chicken thighs on the sheet - they should not be touching each other.
                Reserve any remaining marinade
            </li>
            <li>Transfer the chicken to your preheated oven, and roast for 30 minutes.
                Check on it every 15 minutes. If the chicken is startig to scorch or burn,
                tent it with aluminum foil and/or lower the oven temperature.
            </li>
            <li>While the chicken bakes, make your basting sauce. Pour the excess
                marinade into a small saucepan with the water. Heat the mixture to a 
                simmer. Add the maltose (microwave the maltose for 15 seconds at a time
                until softened). Mix until the maltose melts into the marinade and turn off
                the heat.
            </li>
            <li>After 30 minutes, use a brush to baste the chicken with the cooked
                marinade. Continue roasting for another 5-10 minutes, and check the
                internal temperature of the chicken using an instant read thermometer.
                It's done when it reaches 165F(74C) and/or when the juices run clear
                when the meat is pierced to the bone. Optionally, give the chicken one last
                basting and another minute in the oven for that extra char siu crust before
                serving.
